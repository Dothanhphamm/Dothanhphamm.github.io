There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
